#  One-off modeling exercises, just for fun

So, I got a little obsessed with machine learning. *Like, really obsessed.* This repo is a dumping ground for all the crazy experiments I’ve tried. From predicting the future (kind of) to building robots (okay, not really), it’s all here. Buckle up, it’s about to get nerdy!

Now, for something a bit more serious, let's shift gears to my [portfolio](https://github.com/sdsouto/portfolio) work.  Here are some projects I've completed:
